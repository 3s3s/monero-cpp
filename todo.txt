handle e.g. restricted or hw wallet limitations in wallet_rpc_server, e.g. on_import_outputs?
wallet2 does not automatically save unlike rpc; where to invoke save and how to separate for tests?
throw MoneroErrors instead of runtime_errors
toPropertyTree() should take node as parameter; optimize memory elsewhere
cannot reconcile integrals on getTransfers() test, need to add reconcile debug info including vals and pass error message
re-usable debug trace statements
DaemonConnection is its own object
onSyncProgress(startHeight, currentHeight, endHeight, percentDone, message)?
remove warning jstring2string
comb code todos
mergeTx(), model members are private, use accessors and mutators, return this for chaining
use gnu debugger and sanitize=on
further automate build process
rename external-libs/monero to monero-core for clarity
optimize by moving shared_ptrs
