HIGH PRIORITY
code todos
query args should be constant
ensure model toPropertyTrees(), etc are not unecessarily copying return objects
MoneroWallet.h documentation
sample code including readme
sign/submit tx
strong vs weak references
getReserveProofAccount() jni seg fault
gen documentation

MEDIUM PRIORITY
nodeToTransferRequest(), etc need a final else catch-all
MoneroWallet getChainHeight() calling daemon connection every time, surely better way
toPropertyTree() should take node as parameter; optimize memory elsewhere (move shared_ptrs, etc)
enable debug logging
model accessors/mutators/chaining?
further automate build process

LOW PRIORITY
throw MoneroErrors with error codes instead of runtime_errors
handle e.g. restricted or hw wallet limitations in wallet_rpc_server, e.g. on_import_outputs?
