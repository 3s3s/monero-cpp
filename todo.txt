HIGH PRIORITY
cannot reconcile integrals on getTransfers() test, need to add reconcile debug info including vals and pass error message
testGetTransfers() cannot reconcile integrals: new MoneroTransferRequest().setAccountIndex(subaddress.getAccountIndex()).setSubaddressIndex(subaddress.getIndex())
tx c40d5dbf49172a1a42111e414ee243e8c7a45cf0c09c5d91c5cef21672145755 should have outgoing but does not according to jni

comb code todos

MEDIUM PRIORITY
DaemonConnection is its own object
onSyncProgress(startHeight, currentHeight, endHeight, percentDone, message)?
remove warning jstring2string
rename external-libs/monero to monero-core for clarity
cppWalletHandle, cppListenerHandle string constants in MoneroWalletJni.cpp
toPropertyTree() should take node as parameter; optimize memory elsewhere (move shared_ptrs, etc)
re-usable debug trace statements
model accessors/mutators/chaining?
use gnu debugger and sanitize=on
further automate build process

LOW PRIORITY
throw MoneroErrors with error codes instead of runtime_errors
handle e.g. restricted or hw wallet limitations in wallet_rpc_server, e.g. on_import_outputs?
