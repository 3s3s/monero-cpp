HIGH PRIORITY
code todos
const tx request
query args should be constant
ensure model toPropertyTrees(), etc are not unecessarily copying return objects
gen documentation
sample code including readme

MEDIUM PRIORITY
number of mining threads should be uint32_t instead of uint64_t
getReserveProofAccount() jni seg fault
sign/submit tx
nodeToTransferRequest(), etc need a final else catch-all
MoneroWallet getChainHeight() calling daemon connection every time, surely better way
toPropertyTree() should take node as parameter; optimize memory elsewhere (move shared_ptrs, etc)
enable debug logging
model accessors/mutators/chaining?
further automate build process

LOW PRIORITY
throw MoneroErrors with error codes instead of runtime_errors
handle e.g. restricted or hw wallet limitations in wallet_rpc_server, e.g. on_import_outputs?
